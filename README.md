# Flight-Delay-Prediction
A Two-Stage Predictive Machine Learning Engine capable of forecasting the on-time performance of flights based on factors such as the origin, destination, date of travel, and weather. Unexpected delays create chaos for passengers as well as airlines. This project enables airlines to proactively take measures to minimize the effect of delayed flights, thereby improving efficiency, profits, and customer satisfaction.
